            Interactive Services
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            We may from time to time provide interactive services on our site,
            for example, the ability to participate in games, competitions,
            comment on blog posts or post to our social media accounts
            (interactive services).
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            Where we do provide any interactive service, we will provide clear
            information to you about the kind of service offered, if it is
            moderated and what form of moderation is used (including whether it
            is human or technical).
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users (and in
            particular, for children) from third parties when they use any
            interactive service provided on our site, and we will decide in each
            case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant
            service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of
            those risks. However, we are under no obligation to oversee, monitor
            or moderate any interactive service we provide on our site, and we
            expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from
            the use of any interactive service by a user in contravention of our
            content standards, whether the service is moderated or not.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            The use of any of our interactive services by a minor is subject to
            the consent of their parent or guardian. We advise parents who
            permit their children to use an interactive service that it is
            important that they communicate with their children about their
            safety online, as moderation is not fool proof. Minors who are using
            any interactive service should be made aware of the potential risks
            to them.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            Where we do moderate an interactive service, we will normally
            provide you with a means of contacting the moderator, should a
            concern or difficulty arise.
