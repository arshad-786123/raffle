          At Raffily, we are committed to ensuring our communications are
          respectful, transparent, and compliant with data protection laws. This
          policy outlines how we manage email marketing, push notifications, and

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-8">
          <li>
            <strong>Opt-In Requirement:</strong> Raffily only sends marketing
            emails, push notifications, and SMS messages to individuals who have
            explicitly opted in. Consent is collected via our website, mobile
            app, or raffle sign-up pages.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Clear Communication:</strong> When collecting consent, we
            clearly explain the types of messages users can expect, including
            updates on raffles, special offers, or promotions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Double Opt-In (for Email):</strong> To ensure that
            subscribers genuinely want to receive emails, we use a double opt-in
            process. Users receive a confirmation email and must verify their
            subscription by clicking a link.
          </li>

            <strong>Compliance with Data Protection Laws:</strong> Raffily
            complies with data protection regulations, including the GDPR and

          <li>
            <strong>Third-Party Processing:</strong> Personal data is never sold
            to third parties. If we work with third-party service providers
            (e.g., for email, SMS, or push notifications), they must adhere to
            the same privacy standards and regulations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Unsubscribe and Opt-Out:</strong> Users can easily
            unsubscribe from emails or SMS messages via provided links, and they
            can adjust push notification preferences within their app or account
            settings. Opt-out requests are processed immediately.
